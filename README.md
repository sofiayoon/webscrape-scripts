Simple Python Web Scraping Scripts for Practice

I use Python and Beautiful Soup for some simple web scraping!

## wiki.py
To run, download the script and run `python wiki.py` in your terminal or power shell. It will ask for an input of whatever subject, noun, or anything you are curious about, and the script will output the title of the Wikipedia page, how many resources were used to write the page, and the last date it was updated!
TL;DR Web scraping wikipedia

## quotes.py
To run, download the script and run  `python quotes.py` in your terminal or power shell. It will ask for an input of a famous person's name, and the script will output famous quotes by the person!
